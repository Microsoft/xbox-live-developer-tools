## Welcome!

The Microsoft Xbox Live Service API (XSAPI) enables game developers to access Xbox Live. To get access to the Xbox Live service, you can join the Xbox Live Creators Program at https://aka.ms/xblcp, or apply to the ID@Xbox program at http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id

To learn more about these programs, please refer to the [developer program overview](

## What's in the API:

*   Platforms - Windows Store, Xbox One XDK, iOS, and Android
*   Support for Visual Studio 2012 and 2015
*   NuGet package with binaries for Windows and Xbox One platforms
